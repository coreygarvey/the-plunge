 Now, a study in mice,published Dec. 13 inNature,has brought a team led by researchers at Harvard Medical School one step closer to figuring it out.  Get more HMS news here  The researchers tracked the activity of neurons in the visual cortex of the brains of mice while the animals remained in a quiet waking state.  The research provides tantalizing, if preliminary, evidence that daydreams can shape the brain’s future response to what it sees. This causal relationship needs to be confirmed in further research, the team cautioned, but the results offer an intriguing clue that daydreams during quiet waking may play a role in brain plasticity — the brain’s ability to remodel itself in response to new experiences.   Scientists have spent considerable time studying how neurons replay past events to form memories and map the physical environment in the hippocampus, a seahorse-shaped brain region that plays a key role in memory and spatial navigation.  But what the researchers found next was completely unexpected.
